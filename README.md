[Link to tracking site](https://patrickschubert87.github.io/trackingsite-example/)

This is an example of a redesigned website of an app store for a client from me.

The main purpose of this websie is the tracking.

Before you can see the tracking you need to login.

The login is not for security reason, it's only there for showing real world conditions for the deployment.

The whole website was developed from scratch and doesn't use any frame works at all.

The site is still under construction.
